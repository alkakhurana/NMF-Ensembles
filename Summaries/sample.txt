
   Time ran out for the U.S. athletes when
the Winter Olympics ended Sunday, with a team headed by Brent
Rushlaw a tick away from a U.S. bobsled medal and Dutch speed
skater Yvonne van Gennip a triple gold medalist with time to spare.
   The best America could do was six medals, its worst Winter Games
showing in 52 years. Two of the six were gold medals, won by Brian
Boitano in figure skating and Bonnie Blair in speed skating. Blair
also won a bronze in speed skating, making her America's only
double winner.
